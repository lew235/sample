# sample
I'm adding to the readme file
now I'm adding another line
and I'm going to do something else here so I can see what it looks like in "insights" 
(insights --> networks)

so many changes conflicted that merging wiped out the whole "branch1" readme text!
so I copied text from an earlier "commit" and pasted it in to branch1

I'm also adding a line to the end in branch, just to see what happens
