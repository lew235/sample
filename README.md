This line is being added to the branch with a space after it

I'm also deleting a line

I'm adding to the readme file

now I'm adding another line

and I'm going to do something else here so I can see what it looks like in "insights" 
(insights --> network graph)

Note that if you don't add lines spacing the text all smushes together!

So many changes conflicted that merging wiped out the whole "branch1" readme text!
...so I copied text from an earlier "commit" and pasted it in to branch1


now I'm adding in main, pushing to branch as I would daily to refresh

--and adding another line as I resolve the conflict
